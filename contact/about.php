            <p>Our AI recommendation engine analyzes user preferences, reading habits, and book metadata to offer tailored book suggestions
                that align with individual tastes. This feature transforms reading into a dynamic and interactive experience, helping users
                discover new literary gems that resonate with their interests.</p>
